# Game Design 2 Starting Project
This is the starting project for Game Design 2 at Wichita State University. It is intended to include everything that was completed in Game Design 1.

[Notes on FMOD integration](https://gist.github.com/brianisbrilliant/b9a15cb337bbb82208a18a5220611b6d).

The Plugins for FMOD are specfic to the version of Unreal that you are installing to, so I SHOULDNT have manually installed the binaries for 5.2.1
